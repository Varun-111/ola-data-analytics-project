# Ola-Data-Analytics-Project
This repository contains the OLA Data Analyst project, showcasing SQL queries and a Power BI dashboard for data analysis.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze ride-booking data and gain insights into customer behaviors, ride patterns, and overall performance metrics. The focus includes:
- Reducing customer and driver cancellations.
- Optimizing ride value, especially on weekends and special match days.

### Key Insights:
1. Orders canceled by customers: < 7%.
2. Orders canceled by drivers: < 18%.
3. Incomplete rides: < 6%.
4. Ride value optimization:
   - Rides < ₹500: 70%.
   - Rides ₹500–₹1000: 28%.
   - Rides > ₹1000: Remaining.
